'''Tree

--> A tree is defined as a finite set of one or more data items such that there is a special node called the
    root node and the remaining nodes are partitioned into n>=0 disjoint subsets of which is itself a tree, 
    and they are known as Subtrees.

--> A tree is a non-linear and Hirarchical data structure. 
--> Binary Tree - A tree with a maximum degree of 2
    
--> Common terms:-
    a) Root node - Main node or first node from which all other branches emerge.
    b) leaf nodes/Terminal nodes - last nodes of the tree with degree zero.
    c) Degree of nodes - No. of nodes emerging from a particular node.
    d) Degree of a tree - The highest degree of a node in the tree is the degree of the tree.
    e) Levels/Generations - Group of nodes from every parent node in the hirarchy.
    f) Path - Connection of nodes excluding the leaf node.
    g) Branch - Connection of nodes including the leaf node.
    h) Height/Depth of the tree - No. of the nodes in the largest branch OR Total no. of generations.
