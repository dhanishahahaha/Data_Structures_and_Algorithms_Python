Searching

1. Linear Search - Searching an element in a Linear data structure like a list.
   Time Complexity of the Linear Search is O(n) which means n comparisions to n elements.

2. Binary Search - Seaching an element in a Binary data structure but the condition is it should be sorted first.
   Time Complexity of the Binary Search is O(Log n) which means 10 comparisions to 1000 elements. 
   Better Performance.
