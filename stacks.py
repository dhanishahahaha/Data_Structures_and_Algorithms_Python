''' Stack
--> Stacks are Linear Data Structures.
--> Each stack is assumed to be inside a container with only its top side open, where only the top element of stack
    can be accessed at a time.
--> The working principle of stack is 'Last In First Out' (LIFO).
--> Operations on stack: A) Push B) Pop C) Peek D) is_empty E) size.

--> Implementation of Stack:- 
1. using List
2. by extending a list class
3.
